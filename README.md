Sua Swift
---------

Sua Swift is a project to experiment with Swift on Ubuntu/Linux.

Swift has recently been released as open source and is supported on Ubuntu. But
it seems as though that the main APIs are still too heavily dependent on OSX,
even if there are signs that they may be reimplementing many of the APIs on
Swift itself and they may be more portable then.

While Swift may come with standard libraries, the fact that Swift has great
support for calling C libraries directly means that it is easy to experiment
with new libraries and APIs for Swift. The combination of Swift + Linux will
be explored for many years to come and it may give rise to many such libraries,
until a major project based on them takes over the scene.

With Sua Swift, I start on that path for leaner APIs for Swift. The examples
that I come up with may help to document Swift further, if anything.

Sua is a Portuguese word that means "yours". Sua Swift means "your Swift". It
also is a play on how both words are pronounced, both beginning with about the
same sound. Sua also resembles another programming word in Portuguese that is
well known, "Lua" of the Lua programming language fame.

Given how short the Sua word is, it could also be used as a prefix in some words
to help to avoid name conflicts with more standard APIs.
