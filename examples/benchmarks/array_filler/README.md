Array Filler
------------

This is just a simple benchmark that I used to compare how a couple of languages
dealt with arrays. It fills an array in a couple of different ways and then
checks for the content of the array in a subsequent function call.

Versions for Dart and JavaScript can be found in the docs directory.
